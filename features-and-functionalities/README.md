**Repository:** `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`  
**Directory:** `features-and-functionalities/`

## Objective
Document all backend features and functionalities required to build a scalable, secure, and robust Airbnb Clone. Provide a Draw.io diagram for visual representation.

---

## 1. Core Functionalities

### 1.1 User Management
- **Registration**: Sign up as `guest` or `host`; email verification; secure password hashing.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based tokens; OAuth (Google, Facebook) optional.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (`guest`, `host`, `admin`).
- **Profile Management**: Update profile, photo uploads to cloud storage, contact info, preferences.

### 1.2 Property Listings
- CRUD operations for property listings.
- Attributes: title, description, location, price per night, amenities, photos, availability.
- Availability calendar for blocked dates, minimum/maximum nights.
- Image uploads to cloud storage (S3/Cloudinary).

### 1.3 Search & Filtering
- Search by location, dates, price range, guests.
- Filters for amenities, property type, host rating.
- Pagination and sorting by price, rating, distance.

### 1.4 Booking Management
- Create bookings with date validation and availability check.
- Prevent double bookings using date-range constraints or application logic.
- Track booking lifecycle: `pending` → `confirmed` → `completed` | `canceled`.
- Cancellation policy support.

### 1.5 Payments
- Integrate Stripe or PayPal.
- Handle payments, refunds, disputes.
- Multi-currency support and payout schedules for hosts.

### 1.6 Reviews & Ratings
- Guests leave reviews linked to bookings.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.
- Aggregate ratings per property and host.

### 1.7 Notifications
- Email and in-app notifications.
- Triggered by bookings, payments, reviews, and messages.

### 1.8 Messaging
- Guest-host messaging.
- Conversations with timestamps and attachments.

### 1.9 Admin Dashboard
- Manage users, listings, bookings, and payments.
- Reporting for revenue, bookings, and active listings.
- Moderation tools for content and users.

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Database
- Relational DB (PostgreSQL recommended).
- Tables: users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, messages, conversations, amenities, images, roles, payment_methods.
- Indexing: email, geolocation, foreign keys, created_at.
- Use migrations (Flyway/Alembic).

### 2.2 API
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods and status codes.
- Versioning (`/api/v1/...`).
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.

### 2.3 Auth & Security
- JWT authentication and refresh tokens.
- Password hashing, rate limiting, input validation.
- HTTPS, secure cookies, audit logging.

### 2.4 Storage
- Cloud storage for images/files.
- Presigned URLs for direct client uploads.

### 2.5 Third-party Services
- Payments: Stripe/PayPal.
- Emails: SendGrid/Mailgun.
- Push notifications (optional).

### 2.6 Observability
- Structured logging, centralized logs.
- Metrics and tracing for performance monitoring.

### 2.7 Testing
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for critical flows.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability: modular architecture, horizontal scaling.
- Performance: caching (Redis), query optimization.
- Security: encrypt sensitive data, firewalls, rate limiting.
- Reliability: retries, idempotency keys for payments.

## 4. Data Model Snapshot
- **User**: user_id, name, email, password_hash, role, created_at.
- **Property**: property_id, host_id, title, description, location, price_per_night, created_at.
- **Booking**: booking_id, property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date, price_per_night_at_booking, status, created_at.
- **Payment**: payment_id, booking_id, amount, method, status, created_at.
- **Review**: review_id, booking_id, property_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at.
- **Message**: message_id, conversation_id, sender_id, recipient_id, body, sent_at.

## 5. Draw.io Diagram
- Import a Draw.io XML file (`airbnb_features.drawio.xml`) to visualize all features.
- Export as PNG: `features-and-functionalities/features-and-functionalities.png`.
